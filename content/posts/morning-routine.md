*Get a proactive rather than reactive start to your day.*
<!--more-->

A key part of happiness is feeling in control of your life. This comes from having confidence in your behavior. Repeated wins, or good habits, build this confidence. Your routine forms your habits. The start of your day is a great time to instill routine since it's often time you have to yourself.

You’re at the center of everything you do. A good morning routine energizes you. Focus on the things you want to do for yourself. Meditation, skin care, exercising, or reading are some examples. Starting off with a win elevates your mood for the rest of the day. Whether you want to grind at work or help others, feeling happy and energized will help you do that.

With a morning routine every day starts with a sense of control. This compounds day over day, helping to build mental fortitude and happiness.

## Tips to stay consistent

* Stick to a sequence that makes sense. For example, exercise → shower → skin care.

* Don’t touch your phone. This keeps you focused.

* Get up early. You’ll feel like you’re getting a headstart and won’t worry about responding to messages right away.

* Focus on when you go to sleep rather than when you wake up. This builds discipline while making it easier to get a good night’s rest.

* Stick to your schedule on the weekends. This reinforces the habit.
