*Get a proactive rather than reactive start to your day.*
<!--more-->

A good morning gives you energy. It sets you off on the right foot and gives you time for yourself. A morning routine helps you use this time to get some personal wins before tackling the rest of your day. Here are some benefits I’ve experienced from following a consistent morning routine.

#### Consistent self care

The morning gives you uninterrupted time to get things done. It’s easy to slot in exercise, skin care, reading, or other self care. The value of these activities compounds with time.

#### Start off the day with a win

You go into the rest of the day with momentum. Even if everything else goes wrong, you’ve accomplished something.

#### Proactive rather than reactive start to the day

You decide how you start your day. This framing gives a sense of control of your life. There’s satisfaction in knowing you’ve done something you wanted to do.

#### Builds discipline

Sticking to a routine is tough. A morning routine is a simple, accessible way to practice building discipline.

## Tips to get the most out of your routine

* Stick to a sequence that makes sense. For example, exercise → shower → skin care.

* Don’t touch your phone. This keeps you focused and reinforces the habit of taking time for yourself.

* Get up early. You’ll feel like you’re getting a headstart and won’t worry about responding to messages right away.

* Focus on when you go to sleep rather than when you wake up. This builds discipline while making it easier to get a good night’s rest.

* Stick to your schedule on the weekends. This reinforces the habit.
