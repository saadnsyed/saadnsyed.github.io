*What I center my life around and why.*
<!--more-->

Centering your life around something helps give you direction. You could center your life around your career and let that define where you live and what you read about. You could center your life around family and let that dictate how you spend your weekends. You could even center your life around pleasure and chase whatever makes you feel good. We all have a rotating set of centers. I’ve found it useful to have a fundamental center based on principles that hold true in any situation. This helps me remain self aware and grounds me when I’m unsure of what to do. Here are my principles and how they affect my life.

## Value your time over anything

Time is your most precious resource. This principle may sound selfish, but even being selfless takes time. Volunteering takes time. Teaching takes time. Being a good friend and listening to others takes time. Remaining aware of how I use my time helps me accomplish the things I want to do.

## Focus only on what you can control

Recognize all that is happening in your life but divert your energy where you can be of effect. This doesn’t mean ignore everything else around you. It’s often things you can’t control that cause you to take control and make decisions. Teasing out what I can do in any situation helps me take action and keep moving.

## Strive for a sense of contribution

We are an interdependent species by nature. It’s important for us to flourish as individuals while meshing with our communities. Community here is a general concept. It could be your religion, your company, your hobby club, or your closest friends. Contributing to a community builds a sense of belonging.

## Trust

Trust is a choice. Trust unconditionally or don’t trust at all. When you do choose to trust someone, trust that they will do what they think is best. Help others but trust them to make their own decisions. This gives me peace of mind in my relationships.

## Be grateful

Appreciate what you have and where you are. Don't compare problems. You either realize you have it good and feel bad for feeling bad, or you realize you have it bad and feel even worse. Being grateful helps me work with what I have to go where I want.

## Be transparent

Be upfront - with yourself and others. Lying gives too much weight to whatever you’re lying about. Being transparent helps me maintain confidence and stay centered around my values.

I’m not perfect and don’t always follow these rules. Sometimes situations are too complicated or the repercussions are too high. In these cases I trust my ability to weigh my options. Sometimes I slip up. In these cases I apologize if others are involved. In all cases I trust myself to move forward.
