# My Personal Website

This site links to my public profiles (e.g. linkedin, github) and hosts some of my writing.

The site is built with Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) and uses the Anatole theme (https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/).

To test locally (http://localhost:1313/):

```shell
hugo server -D
```

To update for production:

```shell
hugo -D
```
