# My Personal Website

This site links to my public profiles (e.g. linkedin, github) and hosts some of my writing.

The site is built with Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) and uses the Anatole theme (https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/).

To test locally:

- Run `hugo server -D`
- Navigate to 'http://localhost:1313/'
